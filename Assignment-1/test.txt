For Programming Project 1, the student will implement a linked list based arithmetic calculator. 
The calculator will be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator will keep a running total of the operations completed, the number of operations completed, and what 
those operations were. The calculator will also have an "undo" function for removing the last operation. The 
calculator will also be able to output a string of the operations completed so far with fixed precision. 

The calculator (which must be called “CalcList”) has to be implemented using a singly, doubly, or circularly linked 
list. Any projects that use the C++ Standard Library Lists or other sources to implement the linked list will 
receive a zero. 

The calculator has to implement at least four methods:
